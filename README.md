# ML Project Skeleton

Prepared for iterative experimentation with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

## Structure
- `data/`: landing directory for raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: exploratory notebooks (prefer naming `analysis.ipynb` or `model_prototype.ipynb`).
- `scripts/`: reusable preprocessing and training scripts.
- `models/`: checkpoints, exports, or serialized artifacts.
- `utils/`: helper modules for data handling, metrics, etc.

See `docs/environment.md` for environment setup details and `docs/packaging.md` for next steps toward PC packaging.
